## Procedure
### Apparatus
The given torsion pendulum, two identical cyllindrical masses, stop watch, metre scale.

### PART 1: Determination of Rigidity modulus using Torsion pendulum alone
<ol>
<li>The radius of the suspension wire is measured using a screw gauge.</li>
<li>The length of the suspension wire is adjusted to suitable values like 0.3m,0.4m,0.5m,.....0.9m,1m etc.</li>
<li>The disc is set in oscillation.Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation ' T<sub>0</sub> '.</li>
<li>Calculate moment of inertia of the disc using the expression, I = (1/2)MR<sup>2</sup>.</li>
<li>Determine the rigidity modulus from the given mathematical expression.</li>
</ol>

### PART 2:  Determination of rigidity modulus and moment of inertia using torsion pendulum with identical masses
<ol>
<li>The radius of the suspension wire is measured using a screw gauge.</li>
<li>The length of the suspension wire is adjusted to suitable values like 0.3m,0.4m,0.5m,.....0.9m,1m etc.</li>
<li>The disc is set in oscillation.Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation ' T<sub>0</sub>'.</li>
<li>The two identical masses are placed symmetrically on either side of the suspension wire as close as possible to the centre of the disc, and measure d<sub>1</sub> which is the distance between the centres of the disc and one of the identical masses.</li>
<li>Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation 'T<sub>1</sub>'.</li>
<li>The two identical masses are placed symmetrically on either side of the suspension wire as far as possible to the centre of the disc, and measure d<sub>2</sub> which is the distance between the centres of the disc and one of the identical masses.</li>
<li>Find the time for 20 oscillations twice and determine the mean period of oscillation ' T<sub>2</sub>'.</li>
<li>Find the moment of inertia of the disc and rigidity modulus of the suspension wire using the given formulae.</li>
</ol>
